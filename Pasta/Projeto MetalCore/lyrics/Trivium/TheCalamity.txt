Paroles de la chanson The Calamity par Trivium
You cannot be, you're the mistake: calamity
Sent to destroy all of the good
On this Earth, killing me
You're killing me

The mother of ruination comes to fuck all
Mutilating everything, spread wide open, beckoning
Beckoning me

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes it's way to the inside

I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes it's way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Spewed from the wound of this life's worst cavity; the
Nightmare spreads it's cancerous lamentations, poisoning
Force-feed the plague

Drunk from the milk of death's overflowing sick tit
Nourishing the misery, gives birth to the ugliness
That grows inside

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe

An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes it's way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes it's way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Isolate
The heart from the brain
Permeate
Inject us with pain

Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
We're trembling as everything falls completely apart
Meteor crash down

Come crater our woe out
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

You came to be, you're the mistake: calamity
Here to destroy all of the good on this Earth, killing all
Killing us all

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful


The calamity makes it's way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes it's way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

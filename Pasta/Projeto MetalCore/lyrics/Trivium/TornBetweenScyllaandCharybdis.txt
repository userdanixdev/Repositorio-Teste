Within struggle, amidst horror
Inside conflict, visceral war
Make a stand here, vanquish all fear
Don't hesitate, eradicate
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis

Feel the fear ripening, go taste it

Torn between Scylla and Charybdis

Feast fruits of valor, if you face it



Walls of carnage surround your weakness

Crash down like oceans, wait for the light

In total darkness, drowning in bleakness

Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life



Divided by destiny

Torn between death and doom

Destruction by decision

Fate shows me my open tomb



Apprehension runs down your chin

Masticate it, suck those tears in

Life's a battle, perpetual crusade

One against all, time to wield the blade



Torn between Scylla and Charybdis

Feel the fear ripening, go taste it

Torn between Scylla and Charybdis

Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life



Divided by destiny

Torn between death and doom

Destruction by decision

Fate shows me my open tomb

A fight that tests the substance

Of all that you call your life

Destruction by decision

Fate shows me my open tomb

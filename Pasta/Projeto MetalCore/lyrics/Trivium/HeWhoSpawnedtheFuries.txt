The afterbirth has barely dried
When the king of ruling time
Comes with a sickle in his hand
To devour
Devour

Descendant of chaos

Devour

Castrated the father

Devour

Fearing his overthrow

Devour

Swallowed his children whole



Take your teeth out of me

I have just begun to breathe on my own

I don't know what this is

These eyes can hardly see what is eating me



The prisoners rotting in their cells

Children of this godless hell

Digesting in acidic blood

The devoured



Devour

Descendant of chaos

Devour

Castrated the father

Devour

Fearing his overthrow

Devour

Swallowed his children whole



Take your teeth out of me

I have just begun to breathe on my own

I don't know what this is

These eyes can hardly see what is eating me



He who spawned the furies

Severed the genitals of his father

Creating such beauty: the goddess of love

But the blood that fell to the ground

Made the erinyes



[solo: MKH]



He who spawned the furies



[solo: CKB]



Wreathed with serpents

Eyes dripping blood

Winged tormentors of criminals



Take your teeth out of me

I have just begun to breathe on my own

I don't know what this is

These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

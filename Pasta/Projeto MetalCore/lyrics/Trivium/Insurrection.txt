Paroles de la chanson Insurrection par Trivium
Bow not before his creation
These mortals: "man"
This act of insult
Breeds our discontent
He turned his back
On our loyalty
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven

Forged from fire
I declare this war

A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war

It is I who spawns this fury
Torches: ignite
Blaze is set to engulf all of which we hate
Storm in, eviscerate
Every motherfucker in our way
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven


Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war

Ascend to the heavens
To destroy them all

Solo: CKB
Solo: MKH

Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris

A declaration of war

Paroles de la chanson Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven par Trivium
Taken forcefully
A thing which never can be
Erased by time
Since he made you bleed, so violently

Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick
The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Wearing a mask familiar

A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

Now a forsaken
Ghost in the eyes of her world
Banished for all time
Since he made you bleed, so violently

Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick

The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars

That shake bones underneath

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

Cast out from the righteous life you loved
Vengeance comes down from the skies above
To wreak havoc and torment the one
Who just gave birth to her true love's son

Cursed to roam the Earth alone, a beast
Witnesses as her son now fully grown
Readied arm to cast a spear, to kill
Can't recognize, all he sees is fear

Wearing a mask familiar

A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

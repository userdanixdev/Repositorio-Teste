Paroles de la chanson Poison, The Knife Or The Noose par Trivium
Don't let this ruin all that I thought that I could be
A life amidst entropy is a fate I refuse to see

As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

Fall fast down from grace, the world tries to make me evil
Punished in this corrupt place, life's so fucking medieval

As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap

Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something that they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife or the noose at me

Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
Sabotage
The devious blindfold
You're helping cut a hole from here to here below your mouth
A battlefield

This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man we're only fueling our own extinction

Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
A battlefield
This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man we're only fueling our own extinction

Die if in apathy your submissiveness their weapon
Turn inertia into rage and ram it through like a spear


As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife or the noose at me

Paroles de la chanson Upon The Shores par Trivium
Wandering endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Banished here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I bleed on

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go

I'm dying endlessly upon the shores

For something that I will never attain
Tortured here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I die on

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go

Charon, is this the fate for me
Is the Obolus all I pay
Cursed to wander the shores of Acheron
My eyes must have been missing silver coins


(solo: MKH)

Maggots drinking the blood of me
Insects licking the tears I weep
Hornets piercing, while wasps are breaking
Every single fucking inch of skin on me

(solo: CKB)

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence

Upon the shores we go

Paroles de la chanson Master of Puppets par Metallica
End of passion play, crumbling away 
I'm your source of self-destruction 
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear 
Leading on your deaths' construction 

Taste me you will see 
More is all you need 
You're dedicated to 
How I'm killing you 

Come crawling faster (faster) 
Obey your master (master) 
Your life burns faster (faster) 
Obey your master 
Master 


Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings 
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream 
Master 
Master

Needlework the way, never you betray 
Life of death becoming clearer 
Pain monopoly, ritual misery 
Chop your breakfast on a mirror 

Taste me you will see 
More is all you need 
You're dedicated to 

How I'm killing you 

Come crawling faster (faster) 
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master 
Master 

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings 
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause Ill hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause Ill Hear you scream 
Master 
Master


Master, master...

Master, master, where's the dreams that I've been after? 
Master, master, you promised only lies 
Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter 
Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries
fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days 
Now your life is out of season 

I will occupy 
I will help you die 
I will run through you 

Now I rule you too 

Come crawling faster (faster) 
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master 
Master 

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings 
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing 
Just call my name, 'cause Ill hear you scream 
Master 
Master 
Just call my name, 'cause Ill Hear you scream 
Master 
Master
